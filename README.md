# Movies

This application shows movies from The Movie DB API. More info here: <https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api>

## Run the Project

In order to run this project and communicate effectively with API, you will need a valid `API_KEY` from The Movie DB. Once you get it, go to the `info.plist` file and fill the value of `api_key` inside NetworkParameter > AuthKeys.
